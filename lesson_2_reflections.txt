Quiz 4 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder is added with metadata on git repository. No commits are done yet, so the "git status" command will show you all unhidden files in to be commited status with an "Initial commit" or "No commits Yet" message on the top. 

	$ git status
	On branch master

	No commits yet

	Untracked files:
	  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	        lesson_1_reflections.txt
	        lesson_2_reflections.txt

	nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


I need to do it because of prepareing the folder to be committed and control its version with git
